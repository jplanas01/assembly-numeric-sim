Fortran implementation of a single server queue simulation and a more practical example simulating many separate producers feeding parts into a single assembly point.

The idea behind this was to simulate how supply chain disruptions can be mitigated through keeping inventory on hand, motivated by a personal experience at an assembly plant. Inspired in part by "The Goal".
